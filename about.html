			I am pursuing research in the field of Wireless Communication from IIT Bombay since 2014. I was born in the beautiful lake city of Udaipur. I completed my schooling in Udaipur and thereafter moved to Surat for my graduation from SVNIT.
</p>

<p>
After completing my engineering I joined ACG Worldwide as a Graduate  Engineer Trainee in Mumbai. There I learnt about the process of manufacturing of medicinal machineries and packaging of fast moving consumer goods. 
</p>

<p>
While I was working in the company, my affinity towards telecommunications pulled me to delving deeper into the realms of research. So I took a decision to discontinue with the job and put my entire focus into preparing for GATE. My efforts were rewarded and I secured a good rank in the exam. I got into IIT Bombay and started pursuing M.Tech. in Communication Engineering.
</p>

<p>
The atmosphere in IIT Bombay is very friendly and the professors are polite, courteous and amicable. I am fortunate to get a hands on experience with the high end infrastructure in the college. During my tenure, I got a rare opportunity of working with a renowned group of scientists in the field of TV White Spaces in NICT, Japan. I also got an opportunity to visit France to attend 5G Infrastructure Summit.
</p>

<p>
Apart from my academic work, I have a knack for reading historical fiction. I am also fond of travelling. I am a food enthusiast and being situated in Mumbai compliments my taste buds.
