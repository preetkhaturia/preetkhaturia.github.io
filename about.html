			<p> Well I was born in the City of Lakes, Udaipur, back in the days when mobile phones were only "Nokia" and
				internet was a big thing. I feel priviledged that I am able to witness the best of both worlds!!</p>
			<p> The best decision (or influenced by my siblings) of my life was to leave my then Analyst Trainee job and prepare for GATE in 2015. 
				People who went to Hyderabad/ Delhi can feel that period of time. Luckily, I got accepted at the nearest IIT from my homeplace 
				at Gandhinagar, and those became the best days of my life!!
				
				</p>
				<p>
				Currently, I am working as a Machine Learning Engineer with its applications in GIS and Remote Sensing at Amnex Infotechnolgies, 
				Ahmedabad. I dream to visit Machu Pichu and Norway to see the Northern Lights!!
				If you feel we have common interests, just drop a mail or message!! Would love to connect!
